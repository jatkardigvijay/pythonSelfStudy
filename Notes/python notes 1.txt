Variables:
- Variable should start with alphabet or underscore (__)
- All the characters except the first character may be an alphabet of lower-case(a-z), upper-case (A-Z), underscore, or digit (0-9).
e.g.:
valid identifiers: a123, _n, n_9, etc.
invalid identifiers: 1a, n%4, n 9, etc.

to input a number in the console:
use the input() function in the code
e.g.: 

def sum():
    a = int(input('Enter a number : '))
    b = int(input('Enter a number : '))
    c = a + b;
    print('Sum is : ',c)

sum()

Tuple:
A tuple is similar to the list in many ways. Like lists, tuples also contain the collection of the items of different data types. 
The items of the tuple are separated with a comma (,) and enclosed in parentheses ().
A tuple is a read-only data structure as we can't modify the size and value of the items of a tuple.

Dictionary:
Dictionary is an unordered set of a key-value pair of items. It is like an associative array or a hash table where each key stores a specific value.
Key can hold any primitive data type, whereas value is an arbitrary Python object.
The items in the dictionary are separated with the comma (,) and enclosed in the curly braces {}.
e.g.: d = {1:'Jimmy', 2:'Alex', 3:'john', 4:'mike'}  

Set:
Python Set is the unordered collection of the data type. It is iterable, mutable(can modify after creation), and has unique elements.
In set, the order of the elements is undefined; it may return the changed sequence of the element.
The set is created by using a built-in function set(), or a sequence of elements is passed in the curly braces and separated by the comma.
It can contain various types of values.
